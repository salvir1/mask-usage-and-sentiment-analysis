# COVID-19 Mask Usage and Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This repo is an ongoing project to explore the mask usage and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is an ongoing project. 

## Goals

The goals of this project are:
> - To look for meaningful patterns in how people report mask usage and sentiment
> - To work with various EDA and data visualization tools and techniques

## Tools and techniques used in this project
- **Tools**
> - Python, Jupyter Lab, SciKitLearn, Pandas, Numpy
- **Visualization**
> - Plotly, Matplotlib
- **Techniques**
> - Supervised learning model development, spatial mapping, simple moving average

Masks are touted as an easy preventative measure. The Imperial College of London in conjunction with YouGov Plc have been conducting an ongoing large-scale global study of how people are responding to the COVID-19 situation. They have conducted more than 30,000 surveys in the US alone. Among other things, these surveys collect data on self-reported mask usage. The state groupings that were applied above were used to group the mask survey data.

> - People surveyed in the *spring outbreak* states reported the highest level of mask usage across all months. 
> - People surveyed in the *summer outbreak* states and *no outbreak* states reported very similar mask usage over time.
> - The *fall outbreak* group had the lowest self-reported level of mask usage of any group for all time periods. 

### Areas for further study

- Analyze data from other regions of the world that have seen outbreaks with similar timing such as Europe.
- Analyze other behavioral attributes such as mobility.
